The Blue Galaxy Helper is structured as follows:

- **Header bar** with a [Configuration](#configuration) menu
- **Rating Menu** used to rate worth of goods versus Forge Points
- **Building display overview**, listing which buildings are ready to collect

## Configuration

![Configuration](./.images/config-menu.png)

- Enable Auto-open to launch the Helper automatically when the Blue Galaxy is collected. This setting is also available under [Settings](../settings/README.md)
- Show fragments produced by buildings in the list

## Usage

When you collect from your Blue Galaxy, the Blue Galaxy Helper opens automatically and displays a list of buildings eligible for the 2x bonus, sorted by highest-valued buildings, based on their resource output.

- Buildings **ready to collect** are shown in **green**
- Others show a **countdown** until they become collectible (in minutes or hours)
- Clicking the **eye icon** next to a building will open the City Overview module and highlight the building’s location on your map by making it blink.
- To refresh the list, close and reopen the Blue Galaxy Helper

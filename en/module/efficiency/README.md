# Buildings Efficiency Rating

![Icon](./.images/icon.png) 

Compare special buildings based on daily output per tile, using your own priorities and expectations. This tool helps you determine which buildings are most efficient for your city layout and strategic goals.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Building Efficiency Rating tool is intended as a guidance aid. Some resource types may not yet be fully supported, which can result in incomplete or inaccurate building evaluations. 
{% endhint %}

## Menu Overview

![Menu Layout](./.images/menu-layout.png) 

The main screen is composed of the following elements:

## Configuration

![Configuration](./.images/menu-config.png)

The Configuration interface allows you to export data to `CSV` or `JSON` for archiving

## Usage

- Define your expected values for each resource or boost in the [Settings](#settings).
- Use [Add Building](#add-building) to select buildings you wish to compare.
- View the Score and resource breakdowns for each building.
- Use sorting to easily identify least efficient buildings.
- Use filters to narrow down by building name.
- Hover over any row to inspect building details and associated items.

## Evaluation Method

The efficiency score is calculated by comparing each building's actual output against your expected daily value per tile.

**Score = (Output √∑ Expected value) √∑ (Tiles + 1 where road is required) √ó 100**<br>
(e.g., 20 FP √∑ 10 FP expected √∑ 2 tiles = 1 √ó 100 = Score: 100)

{% hint style="info" %}
Chain buildings are treated as one single entity assuming full connection. Sets are considered as if all parts are fully connected.
{% endhint %}



## Settings

The **Settings** panel allows you to define what you expect your buildings to produce. These values are essential for calculating the efficiency score for each building.

![Settings Menu](./.images/menu-settings.png)

The settings menu is structured as follows: 
- **Title bar** with a [Configuration](#configuration) menu
- [**Settings Table**](#settings-table) with two columns:
  * **Enabled**: A checkbox that includes or excludes the resource from the efficiency calculation and overview.
  * **Expected daily production/tile**: A numeric field that defines your desired production rate per tile, per day.
- **Buttons**: At the bottom of the panel
  * **Result**: Apply the configured expectations and return to the comparison view.
  * **Reset to default**: Clears your custom values and reverts to default settings.


### Settings Table

Each resource or bonus is grouped and listed individually:

* **Standard Resources**:

  * Forge Points
  * Coins
  * Supplies
  * Medals
  * Guild Power

  * Finish Special Production Fragments (including [FSP calculator](#fsp-kit-calculator))

* **Quantum Incursions**:

  * Actions

### FSP-Kit Calculator

By clicking the icon next to input field, FSP Calculator which is used for determining the production/tile value for "finish special production" fragments will open.
To calculate value of FSP fragments, input how much of each resource is expected per FSP Kit, and value will be calculated based on your inputs for those resources in [**Settings Table**](#settings-table).

![FSP Calculator Menu](./.images/fsp-calculator.png)

### Tooltip: Comparison Range

Hovering on the input field will now provide a tooltip with comparison values from your city:

* **Best**: Highest production per tile from your city.
* **5th Best**: Production per tile of the 5th most producing building.
* **Top 10%**: Lowest production per tile among the top 10% of buildings.

### Settings Usage

1. **Enable** Check only the resources you want to include in [ranking table](#menu-overview).
2. **Input** how much you expect buildings to generate per tile daily.
3. Click **Result** to apply your settings and return to the [ranking table](#menu-overview).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use lower expected values for resources you consider more valuable, this gives higher scores to buildings producing them.
{% endhint %}



## Add Building

This menu allows you to **search, preview, and select special buildings**, you don't have, to include in the Buildings Efficiency Rating comparison.

![Add Building Menu](./.images/add-building-menu.png)

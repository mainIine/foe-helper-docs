![Icon](./.images/icon.png)

The **Technology Tree** module displays the total amount of resources needed to unlock all technologies up to a selected era. It is especially useful for planning resource needs across multiple future eras.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must open the in-game Technology Tree in Forge of Empires before launching this module for data to load correctly.

## Configuration

![Configuration Menu](./.images/config-menu.png)

The configuration menu allows you to:

- Export the cumulative resource requirements to a `.csv` or `.json` file.
- Useful for planning outside the game or sharing with others.

## Era Selection and Options

This zone lets you control which eraâ€™s requirements are displayed:

- **Left button**: Go to the previous era  
- **Right button**: Advance to the next era  
- **Central label**: Displays the currently selected era  

Checkboxes allow fine-tuning:

- **Ignore optional technologies of previous eras**: Excludes optional techs, of your in-game previous eras, from the total calculation
- **Ignore optional technologies of current/higher eras**: Excludes optional techs,of your in-game current/higher era, from the total calculation

## Resource Requirements Display

This section shows all required goods to unlock technologies:

- **Red numbers**: highlight missing goods
- **Green numbers**: surplus goods
- Totals include:
  - Costs from previous eras if progressing linearly
  - Full cumulative cost when advancing to future eras

{% hint style="success" %}
This module improves on the native FoE tech tree overview by showing total cumulative needs to reach selected era, not just for the specific era, helping you plan long-term.
{% endhint %}

## Usage

- Plan resource investments before entering a new era
- Anticipate potential shortages ahead of time
- Export requirements for guild sharing, tracking, or personal optimization

# Info Box

![Icon](./.images/icon.png)

The System Info window displays all technical messages generated by the game and provides filtering tools to help you view specific types of messages.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Infobox window must remain open in order to record messages
{% endhint %}

## Structure

![Structure](./.images/menu-structure.png)

The window is organized from top to bottom as follows:

- **Menu bar** with a [Configuration](#configuration) button
- [**Dropdown filter menu**](#filter-menu) to filter message types
- **Clear all messages** button
- **Message display area** for displaying results

## Configuration

![Configuration](./.images/config-menu.png)

The configuration menu allows you to:

- Automatically open the Info Box window when the game loads (duplicate of the setting under [General Settings](../settings/README.md))
- Use short names for GBG provinces in messages displayed
- Set how many lines to display in the message window (`0` = unlimited, which is also the default)

## Usage

### Filter Menu

![Filter](./.images/filter-menu.png)

1. You can select which categories of messages to display using checkboxes.
2. At the bottom of the filter window, there is a free text field where you can create a **custom filter** â€” for example, to show only messages containing a specific word.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the vertical bar `|` symbol to search for multiple words.
{% endhint %}

## FAQ

**Q: I don't see any messages. Why?**<br>
A: Make sure the correct filters are selected and that your message limit is not too restrictive in the configuration.

**Q: Can I save the messages shown here?**<br>
A: This module is primarily for real-time viewing and debugging. For saving, consider copying the content manually or using browser tools.

# Scouting Info

This module shows you the current status of your scout when you enter the map - no matter which map you and the scout are currently on. Farming your exploration sites (from space age mars) will no longer distract you from scouting.

## Menu Overview

* Which provinces can currently be conquered (green background - e.g. third row in above table)
